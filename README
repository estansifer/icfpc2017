Algorithm
    I implemented the greedy algorithm, which chooses the edge that maximizes the score we
    would have if the game ended immediately. We do not use any extensions but the code
    should still run in games where extensions are used.

    I had some ideas for other algorithms, but because of repetitive strain injury in my
    wrists, I was unable to implement them. I was also unable to find others interested
    in working on the problem.
